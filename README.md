# React Native AsyncStorage: Data Access Before Completion

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving the use of AsyncStorage. The bug arises from attempting to access data stored in AsyncStorage before the storage operation is complete. This asynchronous nature can lead to unexpected null values or errors, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

When using AsyncStorage's `setItem` method, the operation is asynchronous.  If you immediately try to retrieve the data using `getItem`, there's a chance the data won't yet be stored, resulting in a null value. This is often difficult to catch because of the asynchronous nature of the operations. 

## Solution

The solution involves using the `getItem` method within a `.then()` block to ensure that the `setItem` operation has completed before accessing the stored data.
